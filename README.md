# CPSC_Assignment3
This is a repository for CPSC Assignment3 Part 2 and 3.
In this repository, you will find codes for jupyter notebook which I used to perform beginner-level data analysis on Titanic Dataset and HousePrices Dataset form Kaggle.
These codes are open source and anybody can access them.

Please go through the codes to verify the data analysis or visualization. 

Furthermore, this repository not only contains the codes, but also the sources, data, plots and graphs, and Results as well.
